# GitHub Workflows

*A collection of useful generic [GitHub Actions workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)*

## About

You can find all workflows in [`workflows/`](https://github.com/jessesquires/gh-workflows/tree/main/workflows).

Each workflow contains comments explaining what it does. Most should be self-explanatory.

Workflows are developed and tested at [jessesquires/sandbox-gh-workflows](https://github.com/jessesquires/sandbox-gh-workflows) to keep this repo history clean.
